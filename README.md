#Ember LifeCycle Hooks
> A handy visual of lifecycle hooks in Ember

## Background
When switching to the Glimmer rendering engine I kept finding myself referring back to various blog posts to piece together what was what so I drew a picture. Undoubtedly someone will have a view to improving this picture and I'm very open to that (see source files at the end) so please send me a PR and we'll make this a better resource for all.

## The Picture

## Sources

I created this visual from MindNode (which is currently my favorite mindmapping program on the Mac) but since not everyone has this here are a few other formats that you can collaborate on (I can translate PR's to all formats):

- [Freenode Mindmap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksnyde/ember-lifecycle-hooks/master/ember-lifecycle-hooks.mm)
- [OPML](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksnyde/ember-lifecycle-hooks/master/ember-lifecycle-hooks.opml)
- [PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksnyde/ember-lifecycle-hooks/master/ember-lifecycle-hooks.pdf) (just add annotations if you want to send updates in this format)
